#descr: This is the router configuration for router 2611XM. To configure the router, copy the code after the "start" comment and paste it to the minicom terminal, which is connected to the router 2611XM. (Actually, i'm not sure if it works like this but i suppose??)

#Open issues:
# - How are the name for the smart serials?
# - IP address for peering link to AS
# - How do you send parameters (after reload > no)
