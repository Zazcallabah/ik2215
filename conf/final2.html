<h1 >1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detail network topology</h1>

<h2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required equipment</h2>

<p>We will use the following equipment</p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco 2611XM</li>
<li>Cisco 2514</li>
<li>Cisco 2501 (x2)</li>
<li>HP2524 switch (x2)</li>
<li>Various laptops for running services and acting as hosts</li>
</ul>
<h2 >1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Network map</h2>

<p>Due to the limitations in the equipment (limited
number of serial and ethernet ports), the following is one of the few possible
implementations of the topology. Router 2611XM needs to be the one connected to
the ISP and the other AS because it’s the only one with Smart Serial
interfaces. Both Cisco 2501 routers will act as an only one virtual router, one
of them the active and the other in standby using HSRP, this way we can achieve
fault-tolerant IP routing in the Service network. Router 2514 acts as an
intermediate router and the clients’ network is connected to it. The VPN
network is also shown in the diagram and is connected to the VPN server, the
VPN server is running NAT to connect this network to our ISP’s network.</p>

Mandatory tasks</h1>
<h2 >2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Routing functionality</h2>
<h3>2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic
IP routing</h3>
<p>We have decided to use OSPF as our routing
protocol. Some other possible dynamic routing protocols are RIP, EIGRP and
IS-IS, EIGRP is a proprietary protocol used on Cisco equipment. The OSPF
protocol has many advantages such as scalability, variable subnet addressing.
The choice fell on OSPF because OSPF enabled networks tend to converge at a
much faster rate than RIP networks in case of failure, RIP also only allows 15
hops (if we need to expand our ISP in the future!) and uses resources because
it sends full updates every period of time instead of only sending updates when
needed like OSPF.</p>
<p>For inter-domain routing, we will be using BGP
to advertise our networks to the other ASes.</p>
<h3 style='mso-list:l0 level3 lfo1'><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:Arial'><span >2.1.2<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fault-tolerant
IP routing</h3>
<p>As stated in the network topology section,
fault-tolerant routing will be implemented to the routers connecting the service
network to the rest of the network (Cisco 2501s). These routers support HSRP,
and as seen in the topology map, they will act as a virtual router and if
failure occurs (router down, cable unplugged, etc.), the standby router will
start to act. HSRP is widely used on Cisco routers so there is a lot of
documentation, it also uses automatic router backup which we found interesting.
</p>
<p>The failover can easily be tested by simply
unplugging one of the serial interfaces.</p>
<h3 style='mso-list:l0 level3 lfo1'><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:Arial'><span >2.1.3<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PIM-SM
IP Multicast routing</h3>
<p>We will set the RP for the multicast routing to
be the router that connects to the client’s network to the rest of the network
(Cisco 2514), we decided to do this because the receivers of the multicasting
will be the clients in the network so it reduces the traffic around the
network. We will setup the RP to come with the loopback address.</p>
<p>Multicast will be tested by using msend and
mrecv with senders and receivers both in the server network, the client network
or one in each network.</p>
<h2 ><span

>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Internet application services</h2>
<h3 style='mso-list:l0 level3 lfo1'><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:Arial'><span >2.2.1<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DNS</h3>
<p>BIND9 is a very popular and common DNS server
and we have group members with prior experience in setting-up BIND. One zone
will be set up (isp2.lab), and we will forward requests we cannot resolve to
the root DNS.</p>
<p>Each device on the network will be properly
named.</p>
<p>DNS will be tested by using dig, nslookup or
similar software from a client host.</p>
<h3 style='mso-list:l0 level3 lfo1'><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:Arial'><span >2.2.2<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DHCP</h3>
<p>We will use the isc-dhcp-server package on
ubuntu.</p>
<p>Servers used for services will get a fixed IP
address based on their MAC address. Other clients will get a IP from the pool
available on the DHCP server.</p>
<p>DHCP will be tested by connecting a new host to
the client switch and observing the IP address it is assigned.</p>
<h3 style='mso-list:l0 level3 lfo1'><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:Arial'><span >2.2.3<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Web
server</h3>
<p>We will use the nginx web server on a ubuntu
server. There are many available web server choices, Apache, nginx, lighttpd.
They are most commonly divided into process-based and event-based web servers.
Apache is a very popular process based server and nginx is event based, to give
examples.</p>
<p>Other than this there isn’t much that differs
between the different software packages. Sure they all have different setup and
configuration methods, but in the end for our purposes it won’t matter much
what we choose. Performance is not very likely to be an issue for a web server
that is only going to serve static pages.</p>
<p>In the end we chose nginx because one group
member likes it and the others don’t care enough to protest.</p>
<p>Web server functionality will be tested by
having any client in the network try to access www.isp2.lab using the browser
of their choice.</p>

<h2 ><span

>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mail Service </h2>

<p style='text-align:justify'><i <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Software: Postfix (MTA) +
Dovecot (MDA)</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'></p>
<p>Postfix will be used as a MTA to send and
receive emails between mail servers and clients on the Internet, using SMTP.</p>
<p>Dovecot as a MDA will be used in combination
with Postfix to provide user accounts and mailboxes as well as providing secure
access to those using encrypted connection (SSL/TLS).</p>
<p>Users will have access to their mailbox over
POP3 and IMAP. We keep POP3 for compatibility sake and for people who do not
need IMAP functionality such as leaving mails on the server instead of deleting
them (great for accessing emails on multiple devices). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will have one unix user managing virtual
mailboxes (such as user1@isp2.lab or user2@isp2.lab) , this user is used as an
intermediate between Postfix and Dovecot and will only have access to email
data and nothing else.</p>
<p>For authenticating our users we will use SASL
(Simple Authentication and Security Layer) along with SHA256 password hashes
stored in a simple text file, for example:</p>
<pre>
postmaster@isp2.lab:BPiZbadjt6lpsQKO4wB1aerzpjVIbdqyEdUSyFud+Ps=</pre
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One great advantage is that we can keep track of
mailboxes and passwords using only text files instead of having a complex MySQL
backend to store our user names, user aliases and passwords, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users will only have SMTP access if they are on
the ISP networks or by using our VPN. </p>
<p>This will be implemented by modifying
postfix/main.cf to only allow our networks to use smtp (no open relay).</p>
<p>POP3 and IMAP will be available even if the user
is connecting from outside our network.</p>
<p>The DNS server will of course contain an MX
record pointing to the email server.</p>
<p>There is another group doing email as a
selective service, and we will be able to demonstrate the functionality by
sending and receiving email to and from them. And also by sending mails between
users on our ISP.</p>
<h2 ><span

>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>VPN</h2>
<p>Software: OpenVPN</p>
<p>- Routed (TUN) device, using NAT with iptables
on the VPN server to connect our client subnet to the Internet</p>
<p>- Can connect to this VPN using certificates
issued by our CA, no passwords required.</p>
<p>- Authentication encrypted with TLS</p>
<p>- Data encrypted with AES-256-CBC (AES with a
256 bits key and Cipher
Block Chaining), we choose this cipher because 256 is the maximum amount of
bits you can use for OpenVPN right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenVPN is free, open source and well secured
compared to PPTP for example, another popular VPN protocol.</p>
<p>The VPN clients’ subnet will be 11.2.0.0/24, we
are assuming that we have at most the same number of VPN clients as our ISP
clients, so a /24 for each network.</p>
<p>We created five test user accounts the
demonstration, there is one folder per account containing:</p>
<p>-client.ovpn, the client configuration file used
by Windows and Android OpenVPN clients for example, for Ubuntu we need to enter
the configuration manually in Network Manager</p>
<p>-ta.key, a 2048 bits key used for TLS
authentication</p>
<p>-ca.crt, our CA certificate</p>
<p>-ca.key, the CA’s private key</p>
<p>-gr2-userX.crt, the client’s certificate...</p>
<p>-gr2-userX.key, ...and the private key.</p>
